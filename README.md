# Code-Path-
"Hi, I’m Oluebube Emmanuel, and my project is called CodePath. It’s a personal website that documents my journey to becoming a world-class programmer. CodePath is more than just a portfolio — it reflects my passion for technology, coding, and creativity. It shows who I am, what I love doing, and the path I’m building step by step.
